title: Using custom shell scripts on OSX or Linux
description: |
  Custom shell scripts allow you to do pretty much anything. Here's a short tutorial on how to set up either OSX or Linux so you can use custom shell scripts on your system.

## Configuring your environment

I'm assuming here that you are on a POSIX compliant system (namely OSX or Linux). First let's make sure we are in our home directory. On OSX or Linux in a terminal run:  

{% highlight bash %} cd {% endhighlight %} 

Standard practice is to keep user shell scripts in a bin folder in your home directory. You may or may not have this folder depending on your operating system. If it doesn't exist create it: 

{% highlight bash %} mkdir bin {% endhighlight %} 

So on OSX the folder path will be /Users/george/bin. On Linux it will be /home/george/bin. Remember 'george' will be whatever your username is.

## Ensuring bin is in your path

To be able to use the shell scripts from our bin folder we need to make sure that this folder is in the $PATH variable. The shell looks in this folder when you issue a command.

If you are comfortable with vi use these commands. If you are not comfortable with vi you can use [textedit][1] in OSX or gedit on Linux. 

{% highlight bash %} cd #change to home directory 
vi .bash_profile {% endhighlight %} 

Add the following line to this file 

{% highlight bash %} PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin {% endhighlight %} 

For the changes to take effect you need to reload your profile. I'm assuming you are still in your home directory. 

{% highlight bash %} . ./.bash_profile {% endhighlight %} 

## Adding scripts

Now we can just drop shell scripts into the bin folder. To use them we must make sure they are executable: 

{% highlight bash %} chmod +x yourshellscript.sh {% endhighlight %} 

That's it. Now you can call your shell script from the command line using 

{% highlight bash %} yourshellscript.sh {% endhighlight %}
