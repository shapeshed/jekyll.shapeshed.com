## Head - view the top of files

Head is simple tool to view the top of files. In its simplest form you can use it to see the first ten lines of a file.

``` bash 
head /usr/share/dict/words
A
a
aa
aal
aalii
aam
Aani
aardvark
aardwolf
Aaron
```

By default it outputs the first ten lines of a file but you can modify that by passing the -n option

``` bash 
head -n 1 /usr/share/dict/words
A
```

In fact you don't even need to use -n. You can just use a number.

``` bash 
head -1 /usr/share/dict/words
A
```

This is useful for viewing comments and the the top of files in general but becomes really useful when you pipe things together. 

``` bash 
FILES=/some/dir/*.zip
SEARCH_STRING="findme"

for f in $FILES
do
  zipinfo -1 $f | grep $SEARCH_STRING | head -1 | awk '{ print "Found in: " $1 }'
done
```

Here we are searching the contents of zip files with a search string but we only want the first occurence. So we can use head to filter the results to just one. 

## Tail

Tail is the opposite to head but operates on the end of files.

``` bash 
tail /usr/share/dict/words
zymotoxic
zymurgy
Zyrenian
Zyrian
Zyryan
zythem
Zythia
zythum
Zyzomys
Zyzzogeton
```

It also accepts the -n argument for the number of lines you want

``` bash 
tail -n 1 /usr/share/dict/words
Zyzzogeton
```

This also works passing just a number

``` bash 
tail -1 /usr/share/dict/words
Zyzzogeton
```

## Watching log files

Tail has the option to watch files in real time so you can keep an eye on log files. You can enable this by passing the -f option.

``` bash 
tail -f /Users/george/Sites/myrailspp/log/development.log
```

This is really useful for watching logs. You can use it for watching apache, mail logs - any file! 

head and tail are simple tools but are extemely useful for everyday usage, especially in piping so worth understanding!
