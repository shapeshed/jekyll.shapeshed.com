title: Gmail and HTML Emails
description: The Email Standards Project has posted a tongue-in-cheek video asking Google to improve standards support in Gmail. Yahoo have acted on Yahoo Mail and have achieved everything in the acid test. Gmail needs to follow suit.

<p>Gmail is a great email client and it is being let down by a lack of support for web standards. If you have ever developed an HTML email you'll know that Gmail does not honour standards compliant code and you need to use tables and hacks to get it rendering properly. This isn't an acceptable situation and the <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/">Email Standards Project</a> is lobbying to change things.</p> They have already had success with the <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/blog/entry/the-impact-of-longhand-vs-shorthand-css/">Yahoo Mail</a> team. Come on Google - it is time to put your house in order.</p>
