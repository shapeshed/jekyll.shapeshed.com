title: Mac motifs on Windows Messenger Live design
excerpt: I don't think I'll be the only one to notice that the design of <a href="http://imagine-msn.com/messenger/launch80/default.aspx?locale=en-us?source=spotlightmain">Windows Messenger Live</a> seems to be heavily influenced by Mac design even down to the OSX style motifs in the background.

![Mac Motifs on Windows Messenger][1]

It seems a bit cheeky to me when Microsoft are as far as I know not doing a build for Apple machines. 

It is commendable that Microsoft are improving User Interface Design but echoing Mac motifs is more proof that Apple got it right a long time ago!
